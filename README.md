# AI-Powered CCTV Crime Detection with Blockchain-Based Tamper-Proof Investigation System

## Overview
This project integrates AI-powered CCTV surveillance with blockchain-based tamper-proof crime reporting and investigation to enhance security and legal transparency. The AI-enabled CCTV system continuously monitors surveillance footage, detecting suspicious activities such as violence, weapon detection, and unauthorized access using computer vision models.

## Key Features
### 1. AI-Powered CCTV Surveillance
- *Real-Time Detection*: Identifies criminal activities, including weapon detection, violence, and unauthorized access.
- *Prompt-Based Video Querying*: Law enforcement can search for specific incidents using natural language queries like “man in red shirt with a weapon” or “suspicious activity near ATM.”

### 2. Blockchain-Based Crime Investigation
- *Tamper-Proof Smart Contracts*: Upon detecting a crime, a smart contract is triggered on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet, storing crucial case details like:
  - Case ID
  - Timestamp
  - Location
  - Video Hash
- *Decentralized Storage (IPFS)*: The raw video evidence is stored in IPFS to ensure secure and immutable storage.

### 3. Secure Case Management
- *Role-Based Access Control*: Only authorized law enforcement officials and forensic experts can retrieve or update case details.
- *Advanced Case Querying*: Investigators can analyze case histories and add new findings through an intuitive querying mechanism.

### 4. Legal Verifiability
- *NFT-Based Case Filing: Each case is converted into a **Non-Fungible Token (NFT)* and submitted to the court as a legally verifiable digital case file.
- *Immutable Evidence Storage*: Ensures transparent investigations, resistant to tampering and corruption.

## Technology Stack
- *AI & Computer Vision*: Object detection models for crime detection.
- *Blockchain*: Ethereum Sepolia testnet for smart contract execution.
- *Storage*: IPFS for secure and tamper-proof evidence storage.
- *Web Interface*: Allows investigators to query and analyze cases efficiently.

## Future Enhancements
- *Multi-Camera Network*: Implementing real-time synchronization between multiple CCTV feeds.
- *Edge AI Processing*: Deploying AI models on edge devices for faster and more efficient analysis.
- *Integration with Law Enforcement Databases*: Enabling seamless data sharing between agencies.
